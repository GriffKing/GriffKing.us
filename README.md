      <h1>My Website</h1>
      <hr>
      <p>This is my website <a href="http://griffking.us">(griffking.us)</a> and obviously it's completely open source.<br>
      Basically, it just explains who I am, and what I do. Very simple.<br>
      It's built with <a href="http://getbootstrap.com">Bootstrap</a>, a custom HTML, CSS, and jQuery framework.<br>
      This framework is under the MIT license, meaning I have the right to use it.</p><br>
      <h2 style="color: red">I'd appreciate it if you wouldn't use my sites as templates, thanks.</h2><br>
      <p>Although most of my sites will be open source, I don't want them being used as templates.<br> 
      The reason for them being open source is for both of us to learn.</p>
